I have encountered so many projects as an individual and would like to work with big teams or big elite designers. My experience is practicals of which I did at college during my development of UX designing </p>

<br></br>
<h4> What Are My Skills In IT UX Designing?</h4>
<p>Because I fell in love with IT and design at young age, which influenced me to develop quik in gadgets and smartphones. This helped me to learn designing on my own phone and drawings, of which many people saw potetial in my design as it is unique. I have equipped so many programming skills to challenge the best and great in UX designings. IT is not easy but easy when focused and I do that very well</p>
<br>
<p>My work requires dedication to the user and work in teams. This was my main principle in my development as people around would like to recommend new ideas and features for perfomance and better program produvtivity. Creating with people is been the part of me and DNA runs IT debugging</p>
